We have data for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans is more profitable in order to adjust the advertising budget.
We will carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. We have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Our job is to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan is more profitable.

We will prepare the data, analyze the data, perform testing of hypothesis to determine if the average profit from the users of the two plans differs significantly and also determine if the average profit from users in NY-NJ area is different from that of the users from other regions.
